# Border Crossing Analysis

## Problem
The Bureau of Transportation Statistics regularly makes available data on the number of vehicles, equipment, passengers and pedestrians crossing into the United States by land.

**For this challenge, I have calculated the total number of times vehicles, equipment, passengers and pedestrians cross the U.S.-Canadian and U.S.-Mexican borders each month along with the average of total number of crossings for that type of crossing and border.**

## My Solution:

I have started with the ordered dictionaries and trying to update them with each and every line but I have found that it increases the complexity of the code as well as make it diffult to understand. 

The second method I have tried is going woth the csv reader and writer, and appending the list after reading exch row of it and make changes accordingly. AT the end, the entire list is just written in a csv file.
